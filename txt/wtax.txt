Some politicians are proposing to introduce wealth taxes in addition to income and capital gains taxes. Let's try modeling the effects of various levels of wealth tax to see what they would mean in practice for a startup founder. 

Suppose you start a successful startup in your twenties, and then live for another 60 years. How much of your stock will a wealth tax consume? 

If the wealth tax applies to all your assets, it's easy to calculate its effect. A wealth tax of 1% means you get to keep 99% of your stock each year. After 60 years the proportion of stock you'll have left will be .99^60, or .547. So a straight 1% wealth tax means the government will over the course of your life take 45% of your stock. 

(Losing shares does not, obviously, mean becoming net poorer unless the value per share is increasing by less than the wealth tax rate.) 

Here's how much stock the government would take over 60 years at various levels of wealth tax:
